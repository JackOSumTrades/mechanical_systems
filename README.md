This is a repository containing several mechanical simulations I create(d)



Future Implementation Plans:
  - Implement a 2D stress FEA analysis 
  - Implement a 3D stress FEA analysis
  - Implement an fea version of a bouncing/rolling ball

  - Implement a representation of earth as a collection of particles  (an object) 
    - 	Simulate the Moon Formation via Asteroid impact theory by simulating both the Earth and the Asteroid as a collection of particles

		
#### Please Note: The majority of these programs are for proof-of-concept purposes and are in need of more commentation
