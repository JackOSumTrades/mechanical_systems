This is a repository containing several mechanical simulations I create(d)

Currently researching how to implement an fea version of bouncing ball for stress in the ball
	- may implement rolling ball
	
Need to implement a 2D stress FEA analysis
	Once that's done, move on to 3D
	
Want to implement a representation of earth as a collection of particles  (an object) 
	so that I can then create entities such as asteroids and simulate their impact on earth and the resulting formation
		(see if they form a new satellite-ie how the moon formed)
		
#### Please Note: The majority of these programs are for proof-of-concept purposes and are in need of more commentation
